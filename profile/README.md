<h2>Purpose of Castle Wars</h2>
<p>Castle Wars is a lightweight real-time strategy (RTS) game for Windows. It is designed to give players a quick, engaging medieval-themed strategy experience without bloat: command castles, mobilize troops, expand territory, and conquer enemies. The minimalist interface and simplified mechanics make Castle Wars ideal for short, tactical battles rather than deep, time-consuming campaigns.</p>

<h2>Main Features & Gameplay</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Castle-based RTS mechanics:</strong> Instead of controlling individual units directly, players issue orders by selecting one of their castles and dragging to a target castle - troops are automatically dispatched.</li>
  <li><strong>Troop regeneration over time:</strong> Castles gradually generate units; resource management is simplified - focus is on timing, positioning and number advantage.</li>
  <li><strong>Dynamic real-time battles:</strong> Watch troops march through the battlefield, siege castles, and victory is achieved by capturing all enemy castles.</li>
  <li><strong>Speed controls:</strong> Players can adjust game speed (1×, 2×, 4×) to tailor pacing to their preferences - useful for both quick skirmishes and slower tactical play.</li>
  <li><strong>Simple, intuitive controls:</strong> Click-and-drag castle-to-castle mechanic - easy to learn, no steep learning curve, suitable for casual or new RTS players.</li>
  <li><strong>Minimalist design & small download size:</strong> The game is lightweight and easy to install/run on most Windows PCs - no heavy hardware requirements.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Unique Advantages</h2>
<p>Unlike many modern RTS games which demand long sessions, micromanagement, and powerful hardware, Castle Wars offers a stripped-down, elegant RTS experience: quick matches, intuitive controls, and a focus on strategy rather than complexity. Its simplicity makes it accessible to both experienced strategy players and newcomers. Because of its small size and low resource demands, Castle Wars runs on modest PCs, providing a "light" strategy option.</p>

<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Castle Wars is aimed at fans of strategy games who appreciate tactical thinking and minimalism. It's perfect for casual gamers who want quick strategic battles, for players with older or low-end hardware, or for those looking for a distraction-free, uncomplicated RTS. It's also suitable for players who enjoy indie or experimental games, and people who like to support small developers.</p>

<h2>Benefits of Using / Playing Castle Wars</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Fast-paced gameplay - you can start a match and finish it in minutes.  </li>
  <li>Low system requirements - runs on almost any Windows PC.  </li>
  <li>Easy-to-learn controls - entry barrier is low.  </li>
  <li>Strategic depth despite simplicity - timing and castle control matter, rewarding tactical thinking.  </li>
  <li>No lengthy campaigns or resource grinding - ideal for short sessions or as a casual break.  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Technical Requirements & Supported Platforms</h2>
<p>According to the project's page, Castle Wars is built for Microsoft Windows (PC). There is no indication of heavy hardware requirements: typical Windows-compatible PC should run it smoothly. The game download package is relatively small (on itch.io ~ 37 MB).</p>

<h2>Installation and Usage Instructions</h2>
<ol>
  <li>Download the latest Castle Wars bundle (ZIP) from the project page on itch.io.</li>
  <li>Unpack the ZIP archive to a folder of your choice.</li>
  <li>Run the executable file (no installer required).</li>
  <li>Use mouse: click and hold on one of your castles, drag to target enemy or neutral castle to send troops.</li>
  <li>Adjust game speed if desired (via speed controls in the game UI: 1×, 2×, 4×).</li>
  <li>Win by capturing all enemy castles; if playing again - restart the game.  </li>
</ol>

<h2>Limitations and Considerations</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Castle Wars is quite minimalistic - it lacks the deep mechanics of full-scale RTS games (no base building, resource gathering, complex unit types).  </li>
  <li>Because of its simplicity, long-term variety may be limited - repeated matches can feel similar.  </li>
  <li>Currently appears to be in early / prototype state (as per itch.io listing).  </li>
  <li>No official multiplayer support - primarily a single-player experience (the version on itch.io is marked "Singleplayer | Alpha release").  </li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Castle Wars Matters</h2>
<p>Castle Wars stands out as an example of how strategy games can remain fun and tactical without requiring complex mechanics, large downloads or steep learning curves. In an era dominated by big, resource-heavy games, Castle Wars brings back the spirit of quick, accessible strategy - ideal for short breaks, casual play, or revisiting classic feel of castle-siege warfare without heavy commitment. It shows that minimalism can produce engaging gameplay if mechanics are designed with clarity and balance.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Castle Wars is a compact, accessible real-time strategy game for Windows - ideal for players seeking minimalist RTS action, quick matches, and low system requirements. With simple controls, intuitive gameplay and a medieval castle-war theme, it delivers tactical battles in a lightweight package. While lacking the depth of larger RTS titles, its simplicity is its strength - offering a relaxed, strategic experience without overcomplication.</p>
